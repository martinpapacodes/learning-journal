# ***Growth Mindset***

**Growth mindset** is the ability to shift your attitude about growing and enhancing your current skill or develop a new skill. When you want to improve on a certain skill or talent, say cooking, what do you do? Simple answer is to cook more. Although like all learning, its always not an easy path to perfection. Along the way, you are going to encounter hardship, and failure. Your dish might came out as too bland or salty. You might make the mistake over and over again and then eventually you give up. How do you fix this? Here is where **Growth Mindset** comes in. When you have ***G.M***, you know how to overcome this obstacles. 

* Challenges
  * As you make the same mistakes repeatedly, people tend to give up. That is having a ~~Fixed Mindset~~, which is the total opposite of **G.M**. To overcome this, sometimes we need to step back and rethink how to resolve the ongoing issue. 

* Obstacles
  * When you want to improve on something, people tend to find ways to not do things. Main reason is because as humans we are afraid of failures. If you want to improve, you have to changes this mindset. We have to **EMBRACE** failure. You want to learn how to code? Just pick up a book, a video or whatever it maybe and just start. 
  
* Effort
  * When you have been putting off cleaning your house because there is just so much to clean. We tend to get lazy. When you go home from work and coming home to a unorganized placed. It feels like, it is not as comfortable.  You step over your dirty clothes, you avoid the kitchen to avoid seeing pile of dirty dishes. * *No Pain, No Gain* * It will take an effort to do some cleaning, but you know that the reward is great. You feel better when you have accomplished something and it translate to other part of your life. WHen you come home to a clean home, you look forward to coming to home. Your mood is better.
  
  When you fall into that **Fixed Mindset**, always remember this:
  
  - [x] Step back, make a new plan on how to resolve the issue.
  - [x] Embrace the failure and just do it.
  - [x] No Pain, No Gain
