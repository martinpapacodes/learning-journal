Most new computer users are familiar to seeing graphical representation of folders and files etc. Back in the old days before the GUI, the command line is used to utilize the computer system. You can accomplish the same thing as opening and renaming a folder in a graphical manner with the command line. Yes, it is not as intuitive as GUI but learning how to use the command line is a powerful skill. 

When you enter a command line, it will take you to a prompt:

`user@bash`
